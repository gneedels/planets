Cold, dry, but everything is my favourite color
The two moons may be a problem to Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
This line is added in the master's copy
We are having fun today building a pyramid for the mummy
The pyramid should be finished in 24 hours complete with gold interior
